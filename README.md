# ForgeryTools

*Doesn't matter even if I stay here â€” [here is there](https://auvicmusic.bandcamp.com/track/here-is-there)*

**Warning**: This code is a horrible mess and there is *no* error handling. I
wrote this as a quick hack to port Fabrication to Forge as I had a sudden idea
due to the fact Forge supports Mixin now.

ForgeryTools is a cursed, hacky remapper built on CadixDev tools to remap Fabric
mods to be able to run on Forge. Its primary features are the ability to convert
a fabric.mod.json into a mods.toml (very minimally, does not remap dependencies
or anything else) and the ability to convert Mixin refmaps from Intermediary to
SRG.

***That is all it does***. It is *not* a silver bullet mystical magical Fabric
to Forge converter. To convert a mod successfully, it needs to have a special
custom "Forgery Runtime" made for it and the mod needs to be designed with
Forgery in mind.
